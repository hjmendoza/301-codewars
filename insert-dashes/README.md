## Problem Domain
Write a function insertDash(num)/InsertDash(int num) that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.

## Solution Overview
Followed psuedocode. Converted number to string. Split and interated through string. Checked for odd number at position of i and position of i+1. Then returned string with dashes after odd numbers.
