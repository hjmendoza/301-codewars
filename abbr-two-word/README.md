# Replace All Dots - 03.13.18

## Problem Domain
Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.
The output should be two capital letters with a dot seperating them.
It should look like this: Sam Harris => S.H

## Solution Overview
After pseudo coding with my partner, I realized there is a simpler way to go about this problem. I split the array at the space and then grabbed the first character at the 0 position for both strings.
